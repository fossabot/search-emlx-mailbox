Hey,

I just wrapped up my call with Alltel for the launch of blipback  
application, and mentioned our MMS alerts to her.  She is not in  
charge of WAP, but Jacyln who IS in charge of WAP is in her group and  
they are friends.  During our call, she mentioned how much she hates  
waking up at 6 am every day for her job and said she wished she had  
one of those cool sunrise clocks... here is what is being delivered 1  
day delivery to her desk tomorrow!

Delivery estimate: December 19, 2008
